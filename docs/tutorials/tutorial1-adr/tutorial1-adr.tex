\chapter{Advection Diffusion Reaction (ADR) Solver}
\label{ADR}

\section*{\Large Introduction}
Welcome to the Advection Diffusion Reaction (ADR) Solver tutorial for the Nektar++ library.
This tutorial is intended to show the main features of the ADR solver in a simple and user-friendly 
format. If you do not have already downloaded and installed Nektar++, please do so by visiting 
\href{http://www.nektar.info}{nektar.info}, where you can also find the 
\href{http://www.nektar.info/downloads/8}{User-Guide} with the instructions 
to install the library. This tutorial requires the pre- and post-processing tools and the ADR 
solver within Nektar++ and the open-source mesh generator \href{http://geuz.org/gmsh/}{Gmsh} 
and the visualisation tool \href{http://www.paraview.org}{Paraview}. If the links to Gmsh and Paraview 
are broken it should be sufficient to search for them in any web search engine.  


\subsubsection*{Goals}
After the completion of this tutorial, the user will be familiar with:
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item the generation of a simple mesh in Gmsh and its conversion into a Nektar++-compatible format;
\item the visualisation of the Jacobian distribution across the mesh in Paraview;
\item the setup of the initial and boundary conditions, the parameters and the solver settings;
\item running a simulation with the ADR solver; and
\item the post-processing of the data and the visualisation of the results in Paraview.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Resources}
The files necessary to run this tutorial are included in ??.  
Specifically, two files with extension \inlsh{.xml} are needed as input for Nektar++: 
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item a file containing the mesh: \inlsh{ADR\_mesh.xml}; and 
\item a configuration file with the simulation settings \inlsh{ADR\_conditions\_aligned.xml}.
\end{itemize}

In the same folder it is possible to find also the following additional material:
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item a Gmsh file to generate the mesh, \inlsh{ADR\_mesh.geo};
\item a .msh file containing the mesh in Gmsh format, \inlsh{ADR\_mesh.msh};
\item a .xml file containing the mesh in Nektar++ format without the edges aligned 
for the periodic boundary conditions (see section \ref{adr-pre}), \inlsh{ADR\_mesh.xml};
\item the 11 output .chk binary files generated by running the simulation, \inlsh{ADR\_mesh\_aligned\_i.chk};
\item the 11 output files converted in a Paraview readable format (.vtu),  \inlsh{ADR\_mesh\_aligned\_i.vtu};
\item the output .fld binary file generated at the last time-step of the simulation, \inlsh{ADR\_mesh\_aligned.fld}; and
\item a bash script to automatically convert the 11 .chk files into .vtu files, \inlsh{convert.sh}.
\end{itemize}

Now that you are ready, let's start!

\section{Background}
The ADR solver can solve various problems, including the unsteady advection, unsteady diffusion, 
unsteady advection diffusion equation, etc. For a more detailed description of this solver, please 
refer to the \href{http://www.nektar.info/downloads/8}{User-Guide}. 

In this tutorial we focus on the unsteady advection equation
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \mathbf{V}\cdot\nabla u = 0,
\label{eq:advection}
\end{equation}
where $u$ is the independent variable and $\mathbf{V} = [\text{V}_{x}\; \text{V}_{y}\; \text{V}_{z}]$ 
is the advection velocity. The unsteady advection equation can be solved in one, two and three spatial 
dimensions. We will here consider a two-dimensional problem, so that $\mathbf{V} = [\text{V}_{x}\; \text{V}_{y}]$.

\section{Problem description}
The problem we want to run consists of a given initial condition (which depends on $x$ and $y$) 
travelling in the $x$-direction at a constant advection velocity. To model this problem we create 
a computational domain also referred to as mesh or grid (see section \ref{adr-pre}) on which we apply 
the following two-dimensional function as initial condition and periodic as well as time-dependent Dirichlet 
boundary conditions at the mesh boundaries
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \text{V}_{x}\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \text{V}_{y}\dfrac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0,\\[1em]
u(x,y;\;t=0) = \sin(\kappa x) \cos(\kappa y),\\[1em]
u(x_{b} = [-1, 1],y_{b};\;t) = \text{periodic},\\[1em]
u(x_{b},y_{b} = [-1, 1];\;t) = \sin(\kappa (x - \text{V}_{x}\,t)) \cos(\kappa (y - \text{V}_{y}\,t)),
\end{array}
\label{eq:advection-2d}
\end{equation}
%
where $x_{b}$ and $y_{b}$ represent the boundaries of the computational domain (see section \ref{adr-configuring}), 
$\text{V}_{x} = \text{V}_{y} = 2$ and $\kappa = 2\pi$.

We successively setup the other parameters of the problem, such as the time-step, the time-integration 
scheme, the I/O configuration, etc. (see section \ref{adr-configuring}). We finally run the solver (see section 
\ref{adr-running}) and post-process the data in order to visualise the results (see section \ref{adr-post}).

\section{Pre-processing}
\label{adr-pre}
The pre-processing step consists in generating the mesh in a Nektar++ compatible format.
For doing so we can first use the open-source mesh-generator Gmsh to first create the geometry,
that in our case is a square and successively the mesh. The mesh format provided by Gmsh shown 
in Fig. (\ref{f:gmsh}) - i.e. .msh extension - is not compatible with the Nektar++ solvers and, therefore, 
it needs to be converted.
%
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{Figures/ADR_mesh_gmsh}
\caption{Mesh generated by Gmsh.}
\label{f:gmsh}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
To do so, we need to run the pre-processing routine called \inltt{MeshConvert} within Nektar++.
This routine requires two line arguments, the mesh file generated by Gmsh, \inlsh{ADR\_mesh.msh},
and the name of the Nektar++-compatible mesh file that \inltt{MeshConvert} will generate, 
for instance \inlsh{ADR\_mesh.xml}. The command line for this step is
%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
nektar++/builds/utilities/PreProcessing/MeshConvert \
    ADR_mesh.msh  ADR_mesh.xml
\end{lstlisting}
%
The generated .xml mesh file is reported below.
It contains 5 tags encapsulated within the \inltt{GEOMETRY} tag, which describes the mesh.
The first tag, \inltt{VERTEX}, contains the spatial coordinates of the vertices of the various 
elements of the mesh. The second tag, \inltt{EDGE} contains the lines connecting the vertices.
The third tag, \inltt{ELEMENT}, defines the elements (note that in this case we have both triangular 
- e.g. \inltt{<T ID="0">} - as well as quadrilateral - e.g. \inltt{<Q ID="85">} - elements). The fourth 
tag, \inltt{COMPOSITE}, is constituted by the physical regions of the mesh called \textbf{composite}, 
where the composites formed by elements represent the solution sub-domains - i.e. the mesh 
sub-domains where we want to solve the linear advection problem (note that we will use these 
composites to define expansion bases on each sub-domain in section \ref{adr-configuring}) 
- while the composites formed by edges are the boundaries of the domain where we need 
to apply suitable boundary conditions (note that we will use these composites to specify 
the boundary conditions in section \ref{adr-configuring}). 
Finally, the fifth tag, \inltt{DOMAIN}, formally specifies the overall solution domain as the 
union of the three composites forming the three solution subdomains (note that the specification 
of three subdomain - i.e. composites - in this case is necessary since they are constituted 
by different element shapes). For additional details on the \inltt{GEOMETRY} tag refer 
to the \href{http://www.nektar.info/downloads/8}{User-Guide}.

</NEKTAR>
\end{lstlisting}      
%
After having generated the mesh file in a Nektar++-compatible format, \inlsh{ADR\_mesh.xml}, 
we can visualise the Jacobian distribution across the mesh in order to evaluate its quality. 
This step can be done by using the following Nektar++ built-in post-processing routine:
%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
nektar++/builds/utilities/PostProcessing/XmlToVtk -j ADR_mesh.xml 
\end{lstlisting}
%
where the optional command -j calculate the Jacobian distribution for each element of the mesh.
This will produce a \inlsh{ADR\_mesh.vtu} file which can be directly read by the open-source 
visualisation tool called Paraview. In Fig. \ref{f:Jac} we show the Jacobian distribution for the 
mesh considered in this tutorial, \inlsh{ADR\_mesh.xml}.
%
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{Figures/ADR_mesh_jacobian.png}
\caption{Jacobian distribution.}
\label{f:Jac}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%
Before configuring the input files, if we want to use periodic boundary conditions, we 
need to make sure that the edges of the two periodic boundaries (i.e. $x_{b} = [-1, 1],
y_{b}$) are properly aligned. Gmsh and the \inltt{MeshConvert} routine within Nektar++ 
does not guarantee proper alignment. However, \inltt{MeshConvert} provides a module, 
called \inltt{peralign}, that enforces the reordering of pair of edges (for more details 
refer to the \href{http://www.nektar.info/downloads/8}{User-Guide}. 
We can apply this by using the following command:
%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
nektar++/builds/utilities/PreProcessing/MeshConvert/MeshConvert \
-m peralign:surf1=200:surf2=400:dir=x ADR_mesh.xml ADR_mesh_aligned.xml
\end{lstlisting}
%
where \inltt{-m peralign} is selecting the module for aligning the edges which are 
specified by \inltt{surf1} and \inltt{surf2} (their IDs in this case are 200 and 400) 
and \inltt{dir} is the direction to which the two periodic edges are perpendicular 
(in this case $x$).

After having typed the last command, we have a mesh, \inlsh{ADR\_mesh\_aligned.xml},
which is fully compatible with Nektar++ and which allows us applying periodic boundary 
conditions without encountering errors. 

We can therefore now configure the conditions: initial conditions, boundary conditions, 
parameters and solver settings. 

\section{Configuring the expansion bases and the conditions}
\label{adr-configuring}
To set the various parameters, the solver settings and the initial and boundary 
conditions needed, we create a new file called \inltt{ADR\_conditions.xml}, 
which can be found within the resources provided for this tutorial. 
This new file contains the \inltt{CONDITIONS} tag where we can specify 
the parameters of the simulations, the solver settings, the initial conditions, 
the boundary conditions and the exact solution and contains the \inltt{EXPANSIONS} 
tag where we can specify the polynomial order to be used inside each element 
of the mesh, the type of expansion bases and the type of points.

We begin to describe the \inltt{ADR\_conditions.xml} file from the \inltt{CONDITIONS} 
tag, and in particular from the boundary conditions, initial conditions and exact solution 
sections:
%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XMLStyle]
<CONDITIONS>
    ...
    ...
    ...
    <VARIABLES>
        <V ID="0"> u </V>
    </VARIABLES>
        
    <BOUNDARYREGIONS>
        <B ID="0"> C[100] </B>
        <B ID="1"> C[200] </B>
        <B ID="2"> C[300] </B>
        <B ID="3"> C[400] </B>
    </BOUNDARYREGIONS>
        
    <BOUNDARYCONDITIONS>
        <REGION REF="0">
            <D VAR="u" USERDEFINEDTYPE="TimeDependent"
            VALUE="sin(k*(x-advx*t))*cos(k*(y-advy*t))" />
        </REGION>
        <REGION REF="1">
            <P VAR="u" VALUE="[3]" />
        </REGION>
        <REGION REF="2">
             <D VAR="u" USERDEFINEDTYPE="TimeDependent"
            VALUE="sin(k*(x-advx*t))*cos(k*(y-advy*t))" />
        </REGION>
        <REGION REF="3">
            <P VAR="u" VALUE="[1]" />
        </REGION>
    </BOUNDARYCONDITIONS>
        
    <FUNCTION NAME="InitialConditions">
        <E VAR="u"  VALUE="sin(k*x)*cos(k*y)" />
    </FUNCTION>
    
    <FUNCTION NAME="AdvectionVelocity">
        <E VAR="Vx" VALUE="advx" />
        <E VAR="Vy" VALUE="advy" />
    </FUNCTION>
        
    <FUNCTION NAME="ExactSolution">
        <E VAR="u"  VALUE="sin(k*(x-advx*t))*cos(k*(y-advy*t))" />
    </FUNCTION>
</CONDITIONS>
\end{lstlisting}
%
In the above piece of \inltt{.xml}, we first need to specify the non-optional tag 
called \inltt{VARIABLES} that sets the solution variable (in this case $u$). 

The second tag that needs to be specified is \inltt{BOUNDARYREGIONS} through 
which the user can specify the regions where to apply the boundary conditions. 
For instance, \inltt{<B ID="0"> C[100] </B>} indicates that composite 100 (which 
has been introduced in section \ref{adr-pre}) has a \textbf{boundary ID} equal 
to 0. This boundary ID is successively used to prescribe the boundary conditions.

The third tag is \inltt{BOUNDARYCONDITIONS} by which the boundary conditions 
are actually specified for each \textbf{boundary ID} specified in the \inltt{BOUNDARYREGIONS} 
tag. The syntax \inltt{<D VAR="u"} corresponds to a \inltt{D}irichlet boundary 
condition for the variable \inltt{u} (note that in this case we used the additional 
tag \inltt{USERDEFINEDTYPE="TimeDependent"} which is a special option 
when using time-dependent boundary conditions), while \inltt{<P VAR="u"} 
corresponds to \inltt{P}eriodic boundary conditions. For additional details 
on the various options possible in terms of boundary conditions refer to 
the \href{http://www.nektar.info/downloads/8}{User-Guide}.

Finally, \inltt{<FUNCTION NAME="InitialConditions">} allows the specification 
of the initial conditions, \inltt{<FUNCTION NAME="AdvectionVelocity">} specifies 
the advection velocities in both the $x$- and $y$-direction (for this two-dimensional 
case) and is a non-optional parameters for the unsteady advection equation 
and \inltt{<FUNCTION NAME="ExactSolution">} permits us to provide the 
exact solution, against which the L$_{2}$ and L$_{\infty}$ errors are computed.

After having configured the \inltt{VARIABLES} tag, the initial and boundary conditions, 
the advection velocity and the exact solution we can complete the tag \inltt{CONDITIONS} 
prescribing the parameters necessary (\inltt{PARAMETERS})and the solver settings (\inltt{SOLVERINFO}):
%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XMLStyle]
<CONDITIONS>
    <PARAMETERS>
        <P> FinTime  		= 1.0               		</P>
        <P> TimeStep 		= 0.001             		</P>
        <P> NumSteps 		= FinTime/TimeStep </P>
        <P> IO_CheckSteps = 100               		</P>
        <P> IO_InfoSteps 	= 100               		</P>
        <P> advx 			= 2.0               		</P>
        <P> advy 			= 0.0               		</P>
        <P> k 			= 2*PI              		</P>
    </PARAMETERS>
        
    <SOLVERINFO>
        <I PROPERTY="EQTYPE"                		VALUE="UnsteadyAdvection"   		/>
        <I PROPERTY="Projection"            		VALUE="DisContinuous"       		/>
        <I PROPERTY="AdvectionType"      		VALUE="WeakDG"              		/>
        <I PROPERTY="UpwindType"           	VALUE="Upwind"              		/>
        <I PROPERTY="TimeIntegrationMethod" 	VALUE="ClassicalRungeKutta4"	/>
    </SOLVERINFO>
    ...
    ...
    ...
\end{lstlisting}
%
In the \inltt{PARAMETERS} tag, \inltt{FinTime} is the final physical time of the simulation, 
\inltt{TimeStep} is the time-step, \inltt{NumSteps} is the number of steps, \inltt{IO\_CheckSteps} 
is the step-interval when a output file is written, \inltt{IO\_InfoSteps} is the step-interval when 
some information about the simulation are printed to the screen, \inltt{advx} and \inltt{advy} 
are the advection velocities V$_{x}$ and V$_{y}$, respectively and \inltt{k} is the $\kappa$ 
parameter. Note that \inltt{advx}, \inltt{advy} and \inltt{k} are used in the boundary and initial 
conditions tags as well as in the specification of the advection velocities.

In the \inltt{SOLVERINFO} tag, \inltt{EQTYPE} is the type of equation to be solved, \inltt{Projection} 
is the spatial projection operator to be used (which in this case is specified to be `DisContinuous'), 
\inltt{AdvectionType} is the advection operator to be adopted (where the \inltt{VALUE} `WeakDG' 
implies the use of a weak Discontinuous Galerkin technique), \inltt{UpwindType} is the numerical 
flux to be used at the element interfaces when a discontinuous projection is used, \inltt{TimeIntegrationMethod} 
allows selecting the time-integration scheme. For additional solver-setting options refer to the 
\href{http://www.nektar.info/downloads/8}{User-Guide}.

Finally, we need to specify the expansion bases we want to use in each of the three 
composites or sub-domains (\inltt{COMPOSITE=".."}) introduced in section \ref{adr-pre}:
%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XMLStyle]
<EXPANSIONS>
    <E COMPOSITE="C[1]" NUMMODES="5" TYPE="MODIFIED" FIELDS="u" />
    <E COMPOSITE="C[2]" NUMMODES="5" TYPE="MODIFIED" FIELDS="u" />
    <E COMPOSITE="C[3]" NUMMODES="5" TYPE="MODIFIED" FIELDS="u" />
</EXPANSIONS>
\end{lstlisting}
%
In particular, for all the composites, \inltt{COMPOSITE="C[i]"} with i=1,2,3 we select 
identical basis functions and polynomial order, where \inltt{NUMMODES} is the number 
of coefficients we want to use for the basis functions (that is commonly equal to P+1 
where P is the polynomial order of the basis functions), \inltt{TYPE} allows selecting 
the basis functions \inltt{FIELDS} is the solution variable of our problem and \inltt{COMPOSITE} 
are the mesh regions created by Gmsh. For additional details on the \inltt{EXPANSIONS} 
tag refer to the \href{http://www.nektar.info/downloads/8}{User-Guide}.




\section{Running the solver}
\label{adr-running}
Now that we have the mesh file compatible with Nektar++ and periodic boundary conditions, 
\inlsh{ADR\_mesh\_aligned.xml}, and we have completed the condition file, \inlsh{ADR\_conditions.xml}, 
we can run the solver by using the following command:
%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
nektar++/builds/solvers/ADRSolver/ADRSolver \
    ADR_mesh_aligned.xml ADR_conditions.xml
\end{lstlisting}
%
Note that we have written the mesh in a separate file from the conditions. This is generally more efficient 
because it allows reopening just the condition file which is much smaller in size than the mesh file (especially 
for large problems). However, we could also have written both the mesh and the conditions in unique file and 
used the same command as above for running the solver (in this case with just one file instead of two as line 
argument).

As soon as the file finishes running, we should see the following screen output:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
nektar++/builds/solvers/ADRSolver/ADRSolver -v \
    ADR_mesh_aligned.xml ADR_conditions.xml
\end{lstlisting}
%
The simulation has now produced 11 \inlsh{.chk} binary files and a final \inlsh{.fld} binary file (which 
in this case is identical to the tenth \inlsh{.chk} file). These binary files contain the result of the simulation
every 100 time-steps. This output interval has been chosen through the parameter \inltt{IO\_CheckSteps} 
in \inlsh{ADR\_conditions.xml}, which was set equal to 100. Also, it is possible to note that every 100 
time-steps the solver outputs the physical time of the simulation and the CPU time required for doing 
100 time-steps. The interval of 100 time-steps is decided through the parameter \inltt{IO\_InfoSteps}, 
which was also equal to 100.


\section{Post-processing}
\label{adr-post}
Now that the simulation has been completed, we need to post-process the file in order to visualise 
the results. In order to do so, we can use the built-in post-processing routines within Nektar++.
In particular, we can use the following command
%
\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
nektar++/builds/utilities/PostProcessing/FieldConvertFieldConvert \
    ADR_mesh_aligned.xml ADR_conditions.xml \ 
    ADR_mesh_aligned_0.chk ADR_mesh_aligned_0.vtu
\end{lstlisting}
%
which generates a \inlsh{.vtu} file that is a readable format for the open-source package Paraview.
Note that we typically have to specify both the mesh \inlsh{.xml} file and the condition \inlsh{.xml} 
file. We can now open the \inlsh{.vtu} file just generated (which corresponds to the initial condition, 
being the number `0' \inlsh{.chk} file) and visualise it with Paraview. This produces the image 
in Fig.~(\ref{f:IC}).
%
\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Figures/ADR_mesh_IC}
\caption{Initial solution}
\label{f:IC}
\end{figure}~
%
It is possible to use the same post-processing command for visualising the other \inlsh{.chk}, 
thus monitoring the evolution of the simulation in time.  


\section{Summary}
The user should be now familiar with the following topics:
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Generate a simple mesh in Gmsh and convert it in a Nektar++-compatible format;
\item Visualise the Jacobian distribution across the mesh in Paraview;
\item Setup the initial and boundary conditions, the parameters and the solver settings;
\item Run the ADR solver; and
\item Post-process the data in order to visualise results in Paraview.
\end{itemize}


\section{Exercises left to the user}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Increase the polynomial order and plot the L$_{2}$ error vs. the polynomial order 
in a semilogarithmic scale.
\item Change the projection operator for a fixed polynomial error and look at the error.
\item Increase the time-step for a fixed polynomial order and look at the error.
\item If the solver is compiled with the MPI option, then try running the case in parallel 
with \inlsh{mpirun -np 2}.
\item Change the Projection Operator to Continuous to see the same problem running 
with a CG solver.
\item Change the solver type to AdvectionDiffusion and CG to change the problem type. 
Noting that solution would need to be updated to \dots $?$
\end{enumerate}
